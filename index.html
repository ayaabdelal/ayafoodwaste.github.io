    <h1>Global food waste </h1>
    <p class="titleText">Global food waste is a cross-cutting issue that starts during agricultural production and continues all of the way to the landfill.
    <u>Over 30% of food is lost or wasted each year</u>. This number is even more striking, given the large number of hungry people in the world. <u>Wasted food is not only inefficient, it's a social justice issue.</u></p>
